#US Honey Production Case Study
##Objective
The objective of this case study is to analyze honey production data in the United States and answer key questions regarding production trends, pricing, and contributions by different states. The goal is to extract meaningful insights that can inform policy decisions, economic planning, and sustainability initiatives within the honey industry.

Dataset Information
Dataset: US_honey_dataset.csv

Columns:

Unnamed: Index column (not used for analysis)

state: Name of the US state

Colonies_number: Number of bee colonies in the state

yield_per_colony: Total count of bees inside a colony

production: Total honey production in the state

stocks: Total stock of honey in the state

average_price: Average value of honey per year in different states

value_of_production: Value of honey production per year

year: Year of production

Key Questions & Findings
Q1: States Rarely Contributing to Honey Production
Question: Which states are rarely contributing to honey production over the last 27 years?

Findings:

Maryland: 1,975,000 lbs

Oklahoma: 2,055,000 lbs

South Carolina: 2,823,000 lbs

Kentucky: 3,224,000 lbs

Maine: 4,762,000 lbs

These states consistently show low production volumes compared to national totals, indicating potential challenges such as unsuitable climate, lack of beekeeping infrastructure, or economic disinterest in large-scale honey production.

Q2: Top 5 Honey-Producing States
Question: Which are the top 5 honey-producing states in the US?

Findings:

North Dakota: 513,742,000 lbs

California: 423,876,000 lbs

South Dakota: 355,726,000 lbs

Florida: 280,934,000 lbs

Montana: 197,173,000 lbs

North Dakota and California dominate US honey production due to favorable climates, large-scale beekeeping operations, and high colony counts. The high production in these states is essential to meet the national demand for honey.

Q3: Change in Mean Average Price (1995–2021)
Question: What is the change in mean average price of honey from 1995 to 2021?

Finding:

Change in mean average price = 71.51 (units unspecified, likely cents/pound).
The significant increase in honey prices over 27 years may be attributed to inflation, increased consumer demand, changes in production costs, and environmental factors affecting honey supply.

Q4: Year of Highest Honey Production
Question: Which year had the highest honey production in the US?

Findings:

2000: 220,320,000 lbs

1998: 219,321,000 lbs

1995: 210,272,000 lbs

1999: 204,585,000 lbs

1996: 197,995,000 lbs

Production peaked in 2000, followed by a slight decline in subsequent years. This could be due to environmental changes, colony collapse disorder (CCD), or shifts in agricultural practices affecting bee populations.

Q5: Top Contributing State in 2000
Question: Which state had the highest contribution to honey production in 2000?

Findings:

North Dakota: 33,350,000 lbs

California: 30,800,000 lbs

South Dakota: 28,435,000 lbs

Florida: 24,360,000 lbs

Minnesota: 13,500,000 lbs

North Dakota led production in the peak year (2000), reinforcing its status as a powerhouse in honey production. The state's wide-open landscapes and abundant floral resources contribute to high yields.

Q6: States with Highest Number of Colonies in 2000
Question: Which states had the highest number of colonies in 2000?

Finding:

California: 440,000 colonies

(Other states not fully provided in the input; assume additional data exists in analysis.ipynb).

Insight: California’s high colony count aligns with its strong production output. The state’s role in pollination services for crops like almonds also supports a robust beekeeping industry.
